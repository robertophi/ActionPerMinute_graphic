# ActionPerMinute_graphic
Script to make an animated graphic showing the average action per minute of the last 'T' second

Uses pynput listeners to measure the amount of actions. Doesn't always works on fullscreen aplications.
The graphic is made using matplotlib.animation

The script shows the average actions per minute on the last X_AXIS_SIZE second, calculated by the average of the last TIME_WINDOW second.
The graph heigth is variable, acording to the current APM.
